### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

My biggest takeaway from doing this project was how the smallest typo can halt the code from running properly. I am seeing that I can do this and this project has really built my confidence, especially with CSS grids.

The most exciting parts of this project were seeing the elements that need to hover, hover and my horizontal line finnaly being in the correct position.

### Continued development

I need to get into the habit of consistent coding and developing an order with my work. I would like to explore the features of the CSS grids and flexbox more. I would also like to learn how to use the javascript to render my code and will definitely be doing so in my future projects.

### Useful resources
